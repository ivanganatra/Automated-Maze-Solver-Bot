# Automated-Maze-Solver-Bot
The competition involves bots which follow white lines on an arena maze as paths and try to finish as fast as possible. There are 2 runs involved, the Dry Run and the Final Run. The purpose of the Dry Run is for the bot to explore the maze as much as possible. In the Final Run, the bot tries to get to the end as quickly as possible and ideally taking the shortest path. Most of the bots are specifically coded for this. Winners were declared through an elaborate point system, which depends upon various factors such as checkpoints on the arena, time taken for the Dry and Final Runs and others.
